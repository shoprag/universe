# üåå Universe

Welcome to **Universe** ‚Äî a powerful, easy-to-use web server, embedder, and vector database designed for developers who want to work with embeddings and vector-based queries effortlessly. With Universe, you can "emit" (store) and "resonate" (query) with text-based "things" in a universe of your choice, leveraging the power of the latest embedding models from multiple providers.

Universe is built to be production-ready, highly configurable, and delightful to use. Whether you're building AI-powered applications, experimenting with vector databases, or just exploring the possibilities of embeddings, Universe has got you covered! üöÄ

```bash
universe
```

If this is your first time, Universe will guide you through an interactive setup to configure your server, including selecting an embedding provider and entering the necessary API keys. Once set up, your Universe server will start, and you'll be ready to emit and resonate with things!

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Universe provides a simple CLI to manage your server:

- **Start the Server**: 
  ```bash
  universe
  ```
  Launches the server with the configured settings. The web UI can be accessed from a browser.

- **Help**: 
  ```bash
  universe --help
  ```
  Displays all available options and commands.

- **Custom Configuration**:  
  You can override default settings using CLI flags. For example:

  ```bash
  universe --port 3000 --log-level debug --provider openai --api-key sk-...
  ```

  Available flags:
  - `--port <port>`: Port to listen on (default: 8080)
  - `--provider <provider>`: Embedding provider (e.g., `openai`, `voyage`) (default: `openai`)
  - `--api-key <key>`: API key for the selected provider
  - `--model <model>`: Embedding model to use (provider-specific)
  - `--base-url <url>`: Base URL for the provider (only for OpenAI, default: https://api.openai.com/v1)
  - `--bearer-token <token>`: Bearer token for authentication
  - `--log-level <level>`: Log level (debug, info, critical) (default: info)
  - `--data-dir <dir>`: Directory to store data (default: ./data)
  - `--log-requests`: Log incoming requests (default: false)

## üîß Configuration

Universe is highly configurable:

- **Environment Variables**: Set variables in a `.env` file or directly in your environment. Key variables include:
  - `PROVIDER`: The embedding provider (e.g., `openai`, `voyage`)
  - `API_KEY`: API key for the selected provider
  - `MODEL`: Embedding model (provider-specific)
  - `BASE_URL`: Base URL for the provider (only for OpenAI)
  - `PORT`, `BEARER_TOKEN`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `DATA_DIR`, `LOG_REQUESTS`
- **CLI Flags**: Override settings on the fly when starting the server.
- **Interactive Setup**: If essential settings are missing, Universe will prompt you to configure them interactively, including selecting the provider and entering provider-specific details.

During setup, you'll be asked for:
- Embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI or Voyage)
- Provider-specific API key and model
- Bearer token (with an option to generate one automatically)
- Port, log level, data directory, and more

All settings are saved in a `.env` file for future use.
